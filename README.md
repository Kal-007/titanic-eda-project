# Titanic Survival Analysis – EDA Project

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns affecting passenger survival using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Analyze the Titanic passenger data to understand which factors influenced survival rates — such as gender, passenger class, and family size.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- File used: `titanic.csv`

## ✅ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Engineer meaningful features
- Visualize survival trends
- Prepare the dataset for potential machine learning

## 📊 Key Steps

- Filled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, dropped `Cabin`)
- Created `FamilySize` as new feature
- Converted categorical columns (`Sex`, `Embarked`) to numeric
- Analyzed survival rates across gender, class, and family size
- Visualized insights using Matplotlib

## 📉 Sample Insight

- Females had a survival rate of **~74%**, while males had only **~19%**
- 1st class passengers had highest chance of survival
- Larger family size correlated with lower survival

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run cells top to bottom
